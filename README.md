# Fun

## Description
In an age of agentic coding with LLMs, I feel it is more important than ever to make sure my coding skills stay sharp. 

Lets be clear, Software Engineering is much more than just writing code. However, I like being able to think in code, and write out programs without having an LLM available.

I often use LLM's at work as I find them to be a force multiplier. So I make time doing fun coding projects with no LLM's at all just to help keep my skills sharp.

## Projects

### Completed
- BrainFuck Compiler and VM
- Echo Server


### In Progress
- aiDiscordBot


## Testing
While my goal is to use TDD as much as possible, some projects such as the Echo Server need more end to end testing which I have not implemented. TDD is easy for business code, however, infrastructure code is notoriously hard to test. 

Where I do test I copy the justfile from my base directory into the proper folder.
